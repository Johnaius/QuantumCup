## Installation
This system is containerized and requires Docker to be installed on your host
system before proceeding with the installation. Here are the steps to follow:
- Download the source code from
  https://gitlab.com/TonySpence/quantum-cup/-/archive/main/quantum-cup-main.zip
- Decompress the image and navigate to the uncompressed directory.
- Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and replace the values of the
  `DATABASE_URL` environment variables (see next step).
- Create an account at https://cloud.mongodb.com/, capture your password and
  connection string, and replace the value of the `DATABASE_URL` environment
  variable in the `.env` file with your connection string.
- Build and start the Docker images by running `docker-compose up`.
- Finally, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to access
  the application.

## System Design

### Architecture

The architecture of this system is composed of three subsystems, which are
directly reflected in the containers generated by the Docker image, except for
the database, hosted in the cloud. Below are each subsystem's descriptions and a
system architecture diagram.
- `Back end Microservice:` This subsystem provides all the data models. It
stores the information in the database and provides an API to access and process
the data.
- `Front end Microservice:` This subsystem provides the user interface. It is a
React app that is delivered to the browser when you access the host on port 3000.
- `The React App:` This is the front-end app that runs in the browser. It serves
as the user interface and interacts with the back-end microservice to provide a
seamless user experience.
- `The Database:` This subsystem is a MongoDB database that stores all the data
models. It is hosted in the cloud and is accessible through the back-end
microservice.
